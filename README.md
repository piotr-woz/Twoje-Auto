# Twoje Auto - Markowy Komis Samochodowy
### Your Car - Branded Car Dealership

## General info
The aplication presents possibilities of the JavaScript programming language in building a modern website for purchasing a car.

#### The project consists of 3 main views:
* **Home page:** Presentation of a list of cars with key information about each of them. The list can be searched by car make and sorted by price and mileage. At any time you can select a car and go to the order form.
* **Order form:** In this section there are several form inputs to fill, such as: payment method, personal data, pickup location. Then you can indicate the date of picking up the car (at least two weeks from the current date with no option to choose Sundays). The last part of the form is "additional accessories" for addition and subtraction. You can also enlarge the photo of the selected car before making a final decision.
* **Summary of purchase:** After pressing the buy button and successfully validating the form, an animated thank you message and a purchase summary will be displayed.

All inscriptions on the website are in Polish.

#### Other features:
* Click on the company logo to reload the page and return to the home page.
* Data entered into the order form is automatically transferred to the computer's memory and is deleted after making the purchase.
* The application is **responsive** and can be used on desktop computers, tablets and smartphones.
