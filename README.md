# Twoje Auto - Markowy Komis Samochodowy
### Your Car - Branded Car Dealership


## General Info
The application demonstrates the capabilities of the JavaScript programming language in building a modern website for purchasing a car.

### The project consists of three main views:
* **Home page:** Displays a list of available cars with key details about each vehicle. The list can be filtered by make and sorted by price or mileage. At any time, you can select a car and proceed to the order form.
* **Order form:** This section includes multiple input fields, such as payment method, personal details, and pickup location. The user can also select a pickup date (at least two weeks from the current date, with Sundays unavailable). Additionally, extra accessories can be added or removed. Before finalizing the purchase, the user can enlarge the selected car's image.
* **Purchase summary:** After pressing the "Buy" button and successfully validating the form, an animated thank-you message and a purchase summary will be displayed.

All text on the website is in Polish.

### Additional Features:
* Clicking the company logo reloads the page and returns the user to the home page.
* Data entered into the order form is automatically saved in the browserâ€™s memory and deleted upon completing the purchase.
* The application is **fully responsive** and works seamlessly on desktop computers, tablets, and smartphones.
